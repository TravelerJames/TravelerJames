<h2>I traveled the world to take pictures and change my life.</h2>
<p class="well">(TL;DR: I did some cool stuff and want to continue doing more cool stuff.)</p>
<p>I grew up with the environment in mind and to be aware of the biosphere. I took for granted that health and happiness came from the inside and one's relation with the planet. I knew too much in theory.</p>
<p>I had to know it from experience.</p>
<h3>When I turned 17, I took a trip to India that ended up lasting 9 months.</h3> I learned Sanskrit and percussion instruments while staying at various houses, hotels and ashrams across the vast country. I traveled by train from Calcutta to the frenetic capitol of New Delhi. I stayed in villages from Agra and made my way up Haridwar and Rishikesh towards the Himalaya mountain range.</p>
<p>I didn't take a camera with me and just lived it.</p>
<h3>During my adult life I made a home in the States. I kept busy as an apprentice stonemason, landscaper, wood joiner and photographer.</h3>
At 19, I hiked and camped alone on parts of the Appalachian Mountains and lived out of a tent for 6 months. In 2007, I audited a course in Sustainable Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the Darden School of Business.</p>
<p>At 22, I backpacked all over Europe and spent a year in Denmark to learn the national language and more about sustainability. I engaged with local activists and college students in Copenhagen, Roskilde University and at SOAS in London. During the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP15), I attended several workshops and participated in building small-scale alternative energy solutions.</p>
<p>In 2010, I received a certificate in creative writing from the University of Oxford in the U.K. and, in the following year, I earned my degree from Piedmont in Virginia.</p>
<h3>Afterward, I became an archivist and volunteer.</h3>
<p>I organised the personal work of architect and designer William McDonough. In this time, I also entertained several non-profit and volunteer positions in the community. Examples include the special health needs camp for children and the college's organic vegetable garden project.</p>
<p>These experiences helped fortify my resolve to act locally while thinking globally.</p>
<h3>I have since contributed prose, poems and photos to various publications.</h3> Notably, my writing has appeared in the Turl Times and the Fall Line. In 2013, my photographs garnered several honourable mentions and nominations from international competitions such as the <a class="" href="http://www.photoawards.com/en/Pages/Gallery/hmention2013NON.php" target="_blank">International Photography Awards,</a> <a class="" href="http://www.thecolorawards.com/" target="_blank">Photography Masters Cup</a>, and <a class="" href="http://www.thespiderawards.com/gallery/7th/gallery.php?g&amp;x=a&amp;cid=111&amp;fid=92197" target="_blank">Black and White Spider Awards</a>.</p>
<h3>I currently reside in Stockholm, Sweden.</h3>
<p>I am employed as an image specialist for an electronics wholesale distributor. In my personal time, I learn HTML5 and CSS3 programming and am compiling a book of prose. You can reach me directly by phone or e-mail regarding photography, travel tips or anything else on your mind.</p>
